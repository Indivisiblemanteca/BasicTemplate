NO to Graham-Cassidy Trumpcare Zombie 

 Americans have made our voices heard: we do NOT want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and we do NOT want any form of Trumpcare. 

 The GOP is trying to bring Trumpcare back from the dead with the Graham-Cassidy proposal. This version of Trumpcare specifically targets California's funding, cutting $28 billion a year from the state's healthcare system. 

 Join us to ask Jeff Denham to publicly commit to opposing the Graham-Cassidy proposal. You are welcome to come dressed as a zombie or mummy, or come as you are. Please bring signs referencing the Graham-Cassidy Proposal.
