Join us at our first holiday party. The party will be a potluck and white elephant sock exchange event. 

 If you are attending, please bring a pair of wrapped fuzzy/crazy socks that are not more than $10. If you are a woman, please bring a pair of woman socks and if you are a man, please bring a pair of male socks. 

 If you would like to bring a food item for the potluck, please message us so that we can make sure that multiple people don't bring the same dishes. 

 Anyone and everyone is invited! Please RSVP.
