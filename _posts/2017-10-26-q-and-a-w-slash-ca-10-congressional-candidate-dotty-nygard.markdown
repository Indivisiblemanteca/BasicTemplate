Indivisible Manteca is planning to have a Q&A with every CA-10 Congressional Candidate so that we can get to know the candidates who want to represent the people of our district and what they stand for. 

 We will be meeting , to have a Q&A with CA-10 Congressional Candidate Dotty Nygard. This is the perfect time to ask Ms. Nygard any questions and/or concerns that you may have for her!
