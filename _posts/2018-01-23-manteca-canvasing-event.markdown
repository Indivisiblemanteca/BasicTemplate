Join us to knock on doors in Manteca!

The goal is simple: Flip the House in the 2018 midterm elections and put a check on the Trump agenda.

It's okay if you've never done this before, we will have a training at 10 am and then go out in pairs to talk with residents about the issues that matter to them.

BRING: a water bottle, a pen, sunscreen, a hat, comfortable clothing and shoes for walking, and a great attitude. Other materials will be provided.

You may get a call and/or email from someone on our team to see if you have additional questions or need help with the app.
