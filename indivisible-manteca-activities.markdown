Indivisible Manteca is planning to have a Q&A with every CA-10 Congressional Candidate so that we can get to know the candidates who want to represent the people of our district and what they stand for. 

 We will be meeting at Wayne Adler's house, the founder and President of Indivisible Manteca, to have a Q&A with CA-10 Congressional Candidate Mike Barkley. This is the perfect time to ask Mr. Barkley any questions and/or concerns that you may have for him! Contact us at indivisiblemanteca10@gmail.com for address of event.
