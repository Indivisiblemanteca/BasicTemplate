We want to say THANK YOU to everyone who made this happen!Over $1,000 was raised from about 45 donors and 88 volunteers came out to help paint from all over the valley! This is what we call grassroots organizing!

Shoutout to Kia Duras-Carter (IG: colorfulkia) for accepting the invite to be the artist for this beautiful mural.
