Indivisible Manteca is planning to have a Q&A with every CA-10 Congressional Candidate so that we can get to know the candidates who want to represent the people of our district and what they stand for. 

 We will be meeting at Laura Scarborough's house, the Secretary and member of Indivisible Manteca, to have a Q&A with CA-10 Congressional Candidate Seth Vaughn. This is the perfect time to ask Mr. Vaughn any questions and/or concerns that you may have for him!
